Description (from "Main") comment:
	This game is simple top down, 2D movement arcade game.
 	The player spawns in the center, and needs to navigate 4 corridors and collect all keys to win the game
 	For each key the character collects, their speed is increased by 25%
 	If the character hits an enemy (red ball), the speed is set back to the base speed and they lose one life
 	Only a maximum of 3 lives are given
	*Note* There is embedded music, although it might be quiet

Additional Comments:
	What we would add: 
		If we had more time on this project, we would like to implement more enemies and maps and maybe character abilities.
		We were able to make one map, although created a polymorhised "GameMap" class to create other ones.
		Additional enemies would include: spikes, enemies that move in more unpredictable patterns, and perhaps even traps
		Additional maps would have more walls, more objectives, and a different variety of enemies
		Additional character abilities could include shields, extra life boosts, different speed boosts, and even debuffs

	What happened for this project:
		A great majority of the programming, video creation, and commenting came down to two team members: Matthew Butler and Matthew Wolfe.
		With the sparsity of working members, it was difficult to complete all of the project objectives, although a working version was completed.
		One of these missing requirements is test cases.
